    'Viola Desmond was selected to become a future symbol of Canada through the new $10 \
bill arriving late 2018 – being the first black person ever to be featured on a \
Canadian bill.',
     
    'In 2012, Canada Post issued a postage stamp displaying an image of Viola’s face.',
    
    'In Halifax, fighting against racism and segregation was very rare, and it would be \
very hard for Viola because she was both black and a woman, for black women were \
expected to follow the rules of society and not complain about their situation.',
    
    'In Halifax, it was rare for a white person to marry a black person, which was the \
case with Viola’s parents (also known as interracial marriage).',
    
    'Viola was charged around $26 (amounting to around $376 today) for refusing to pay \
the difference in tax between the balcony and main floor ticket prices, even though \
she had clearly stated that she was willing to pay the ticket, and knew that they \
weren’t giving her the ticket because she was black. Viola had just been unrightly \
fined for basically not wanting to follow tradition/customs.',
    
    'In the theatre, Viola refused to leave her seat, and a police officer was called. \
She was forced out of the theatre, injuring her hip and knee in the process and was \
taken to jail.',
    
    'In 2017, Desmond was admitted to Canada’s Walk of Fame under the category of \
Philanthropy & Humanities.',
    
    'Viola\'s actions had given the Black community hope, and allowed them to gain \
courage in fighting against segregation. Viola was the spark in what would become \
the legal ending of segregation in Nova Scotia. This was due to members of Nova \
Scotia’s Black population who were fed up with the life they lived as second-class \
citizens. They joined together to create a civil rights movement, and this was all \
because of Viola’s bravery and courage fighting against the unjust.',
    
    'On April 15th, 2010 – 45 years after Viola’s death – Mayann Francis, Nova Scotia \
Lieutenant-Governor, pardoned and apologized to Viola, and stated that her \
conviction was an abuse of justice, and that the charges were unfair and shouldn’t \
have been laid. This was the first posthumous pardon to be granted in Canada.',
    
    'Viola\'s sister, Wanda Robson, had published a book detailing her sister\'s \
experience, called Sister to Courage (2010).',
    
    'Black Canadians who fought against racism would often be hurt and threatened from \
those who do not want society to change. To prevent her family and community from \
harm, Viola did not have a 3rd court case, and she closed her very successful \
business and schools across Nova Scotia.'
  ],
  'threeArgs': [
   '<b>Argument #1: </b>As I mentioned before, Viola Desmond was not famous from birth. \
Her job was a \
business woman for the rising fashion trend in the 20th century, and not many people knew\
 her then. Her great achievement was being the spark of the start in ending racism in \
Nova Scotia. She had accomplished this by being different, by standing up to the manager \
of the Roseland Theatre when he told her to sit with the other Blacks. She told him that \
she wouldn’t budge from the main floor seat (the place where the Whites sit), for she was\
 willing to pay for it and it wasn’t a rule that Blacks weren’t allowed to sit there, but\
 rather a custom that she thought was ridiculous. This argument agrees with the enduring \
achievement hypothesis for it shows that prolonged fame only comes from those who dared \
to be \
different, and in this case, weren’t going to let mere customs change the way they are \
treated in life.',
    '<b>Argument #2: </b>Another way Viola was unlike the average – different – was when \
she didn’t give up \
fighting, even after the security guard had dragged her out of the theatre, injuring her,\
 and locking her up in a jail cell overnight. Viola wasn’t going to let this intimidate \
her, and she even shoved it in their faces by maintaining an upright, confident position,\
 even though she was in a jail cell and was afraid for her future. The average person \
would’ve realized that this was a fight that they had little chance in winning, and \
would’ve given up by then. They would’ve simply apologized and pretended that the \
incident \
never happened. However, as I’ve said many times before, Viola was far from average. She \
did what she knew was right, and fought back against the theatre in multiple lawsuits. \
What makes things more amazing is that not even the Blacks in her city wanted her to do \
this, for it would give the Whites a better reason to discriminate them. On top of all \
this, Viola was a black woman, one of the lowest ‘social classes’ there were, for black \
women were known to follow the customs and not complain or challenge them. Her \
perseverance is what helped start the realization of change amongst the Blacks in Nova \
Scotia, and after she died, the people of Nova Scotia had listened to her actions and \
followed in her footsteps, to abolish segregation in one of our very provinces – \
something that only a great achiever could do.',
    '<b>Argument #3: </b>It has been around 53 years since Viola’s death, and her name is\
 still known amongst\
 many Canadians, and is soon going to be further recognized when a picture of her appears\
 on the $10 Canadian Bill, set to arrive in late 2018. Viola’s fame did not come free. \
After losing her lawsuits and the ever increasing pressure to leave Nova Scotia from \
Blacks that started to bother her about quitting the fight (her husband even divorced \
with her due to this), she decided to close all of her successful businesses (something \
that could jeopardize one’s future), and leave Canada for the United States, where not \
much is known about her after her departure. Fame doesn’t always come from immediate \
success. Viola didn’t win the fight against segregation herself, but she had instead \
created a spark that led to the abolishment of segregation in Nova Scotia a few years \
later. \
In Viola’s perspective, she was not successful in what she tried to do, but she was \
successful in \
the eyes of others, who she was not able to see before her death. Viola Desmond is truly \
a great achiever, and her name, along with what she did, will be known by many Canadians \
in the near future and perhaps in the distant future as well, along with every other \
great achiever.'

  'descOfTerms': {
    'great': 'Of an extent, amount, or intensity considerably above the normal or \
average. <br>',

	'famousVsGreatAchiever': '<b>What is the difference between being famous and being a \
great achiever?</b> <br> \
A famous person is someone that became popular from birth, or for a short term \
accomplishment. However, when great achievers become famous, it is for an action that \
had a long-term consequence – unlike short term actions we see from famous people such as\
 releasing a hit song or being an actor in a popular movie. Great Achievers become famous\
 for their actions that have long term effects and for the perseverance they show \
through challenges they face to get their long term fame – something that \
short term fame doesn\'t have much of. For example, celebrities aren’t considered \
great achievers because they didn’t do anything ‘great,’ something that helped improve \
society/humans in a major way, and for a long time – the impacts of great achievers \
ripples consequences far into the future. People such as Thomas Edison or Albert Einstein\
 are still known to this day because of their great inventions/discoveries that took \
many years to execute and many challenges to tread through, something famous people \
aren\'t familiar with. People such as singers or actors that had died a long time ago \
aren\'t remembered as well as these people, unless they were great achievers who showed \
dedication and courage when performing actions with long-term benefits for society.',

	'fame': 'The condition of being known or talked about by many people, especially on \
account of notable achievements – fame must mean that they are remembered by their \
actions, and not just by their look or their name. Also, their achievements must be \
notable – defined as \'worthy of attention or notice; remarkable,\' meaning \
that it was something that deserved attention because of the impact it had, and the \
impact should be one with long term (positive) consequences. Often, great achievers could\
 care less about fame. They care more about the benefits of their actions that lead them \
to the fame that they were never really after.',

	'long': 'It is recommended for this project that the person you are \
researching has been dead for more than 50 years – the person I chose died in 1965, \
around 53 years ago.',

	'different': 'Being different means not being average. Those daring to be different \
must not be shy to stand out, and not let conformity/comfort take over them. They \
persevere when an average person would have given up, and they look at the bigger \
picture – they focus more on the long term consequences more than the short term ones.'
  },
  
  'agreeOrDisagree': '<b><span style="text-align: center">Do you agree or disagree \
with the hypothesis? Why or why not?</span></b> <br>I agree with the hypothesis because \
great achievers are recognized as people that \
changed/caused a major impact in the world, those that should be remembered throughout \
history. These people helped create a long-term change that will have consequences far \
into the future. The person I chose for \
this assignment is Viola Desmond, someone who is known as a great achiever because she \
decided to take a stand against segregation, which is very rare for black people, \
especially women. Her actions had rose a spark that would become the end of segregation \
in Nova Scotia, and this would have powerful effects on the future of the province for a \
long time, and this is what differentiates Viola Desmond from a regular famous person.',

  'primaryQuestion': 'Viola Desmond has achieved fame – in fact, she is planned to \
appear on the Canadian $10 bill in late 2018 – because she dared to be different. She \
started as a businesswoman, but that\'s not different, and not many people knew about her\
 then.\
 What really made her different was when she said no to segregation at a cinema, when the\
 manager told her to sit with the other Blacks (who had a poorer view of the cinema) and \
Viola had refused, for she wanted a ticket for the balcony seats (which were for \
White people), and she was also willing to pay the extra price for those seats. \
However, it wasn\'t just this that made her famous, for anybody could \
refuse something, but it was rather the perseverance that got people to know her, the \
fact that she started fighting for it, even sacrificing her successful businesses for \
the greater good – abolishing segregation in Nova Scotia. This action of hers, giving \
up her own time and possessions as a sacrifice for a long-term accomplishment on a \
wider scale, that is how Viola dared to be different and now will be honoured with \
her being featured on a $10 bill, something that not many people – even the most famous \
ones – get to brag about.',
